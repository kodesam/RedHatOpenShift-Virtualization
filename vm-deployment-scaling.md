# VM Scaling Summary

## VM Deployment Strategies

- Use efficient deployment strategies to manage large-scale VM creation.
- Utilize tools like JetSki for IPI (Installer-provisioned installation) to deploy OpenShift clusters.

## Performance Benchmarks

- Measure and analyze the performance of cloning multiple VM images from a golden image source.
- Track individual VM deployment times to optimize the process.

## Configuration and Tuning

- Apply specific configurations and tuning parameters to handle high-scale environments.
- Adjust settings like rate limiting, Prometheus storage, and network configurations for optimal performance.

## Scaling Workflows

- Implement workflows for boot storm, IO scaling, and migration to ensure smooth scaling of VMs.
- Use tools and scripts to automate and streamline the scaling process.
