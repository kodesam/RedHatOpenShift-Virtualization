# Virtual Machine Migration Workflows

## Migration Planning

- Develop a clear migration plan to ensure a smooth transition.
- Assess the current infrastructure and identify potential challenges.

## Migration Execution

- Use tools like the Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) to automate and orchestrate the migration process.
- Monitor the health and performance of VMs during migration to ensure minimal disruption.

## End-to-End VMs Migration

The chart below presents the migration duration of 6000 running VMs, starting at the request time per VM, and ending once the VM is rescheduled and running on a different worker node, with all VMs being idle during the migration process. As shown in the chart, 3200 VMs of the total 6000 VMs were successfully migrated, within 33 minutes, with an average time of 33 seconds per VM.

## Post-Migration Validation

- Validate the migrated VMs to ensure they are functioning correctly.
- Perform any necessary tuning and adjustments to optimize performance.
